Newcomer Metrics and Gamification project is a part of [GSoC'18 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5456264041594880/) with [coala](https://coala.io/). In which I worked on gamifying the contributon to open source so that
people learn to contribute in a fun way i.e. They will get some points and badges for creating
pull request and issues. Read more about the project [here](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0020.md). And View the source code [here](http://projects.coala.io/GSoC/2018/StatusReport/shrikrishna).
